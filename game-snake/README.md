# snake-console-game

This is simple snake console game which I made for my programming classes. 
If I happened to do something wrong or there is a better way, please feel free to comment and share your own ideas. 

### Prerequisites

Made on Ubuntu 18.10 .
You just need to run snake.out in your console.
```
./snake.out
```
Or compile the whole project by your own. 
```
g++ *.cpp
```
