# factorial-of-big-numbers
small C++ program for counting factorials from big numbers which I made for school project.

vector - based on vector library.
tablica static int - based on predefined table[example 200]
container - template for my own vector like class. 
counting factorial with container class (The best one) - same as tablica static int but using container<int> template.

FUTURE: I want it to based on dynamic array
