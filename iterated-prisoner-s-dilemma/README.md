# iterated prisoner's dilemma

Made a simple model for iterated prisoner's dilema. It takes 500 players to play with eachother. After each round, two players with the worst score falls out of the game. Program at the end prints top3 players with their score(the lower the better), and their tactic table. Decision of player is based on his two previous games.
